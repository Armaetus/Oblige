# OBSIDIAN
by the ObAddon Community.

## INTRODUCTION

OBSIDIAN is a random level generator for classic FPS titles.
The goal is to produce good levels which are fun to play.

Features of OBSIDIAN include:

* high quality levels, e.g. outdoor areas and caves!
* easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines)
* built-in node builder, so the levels are ready to play
* uses the LUA scripting language for easy customisation

## COMPATIBLE GAMES

* Doom 1 / The Ultimate Doom / Doom 2 / Final Doom  
  These are the primary target for Obsidian and have the highest level of support, with the most prefabs, modules, and available addons.
  New features are most likely to be implemented for these games first.
    
* Heretic  
  Moderate level of support, with some advanced modules and a handful of addons available.
  
* Chex Quest 3 (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support, with a handful of unique prefabs.
  
* HacX 1.2 (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support.
  
* Harmony (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support.
  
* Hexen (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support. Game progression is linear and episodic, with no hubs present. The game will end after the last level generated. The Death Wyvern is absent from the monster table due to the    infeasibility of scripting and flight pathing with randomly generated layouts.
  
* Strife (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support. Quests/multiple endings not yet implemented. Progression is linear and game will end after the last level generated.
  
* Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny (Unstable branch only)  
  Moderate level of support.
  
* Super Noah's Ark 3D (Unstable branch only)  
  Basic level of support. 

## QUICK START GUIDE (Windows)

First, unpack the zip somewhere .  Make sure it is extracted with folders, and also make sure the OBSIDIAN.EXE file gets extracted too.

Double click on the OBSIDIAN icon to run it.  Select the game in the top left panel, and any other options which take your fancy. Then click the BUILD button in the top left panel, and pick a location in which to save your file.

OBSIDIAN will then build all the maps, showing a blueprint of each one as it goes, and if everything goes smoothly the output file (e.g. "TEST.WAD") will be created at the end.  Then you can play it using the normal method for playing mods with that game (e.g. for DOOM source ports: dragging-n-dropping the WAD file onto the source port's EXE is usually enough).
